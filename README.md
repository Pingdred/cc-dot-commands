Introducing the Cheshire Cat AI `dot commands` plugin, a handy utility designed to simplify and speed up your plugin development process. This tool allows you to interact with the Cat internals directly through chat commands. No need to switch contexts or break your workflowâ€”just type commands starting with a dot (.) to perform various actions.



**Important**

This plugin uses internal mechanisms of Cheshire Cat that are not publicly released. It is not recommended to use it as an example.
